# My Business Scientist Journey | Bridging Data and Strategy

Welcome! Lokman here, I'm on a captivating journey as a Business Scientist, where data-driven insights meet strategic decision-making. This repository is a testament to my exploration of the dynamic intersection of data science and business strategy.

## About Me

I'm Lokman Hakim, passionate about deciphering data's hidden narratives and translating them into strategies that drive success. My background in as Project Architect, Sr. Strategist & Operation Manager equips me with a unique blend of analytical skills and strategic acumen.

## My Goals

1. **Learn the Fundamentals**: I'll start by diving into the basics of data science, web developing, including statistics, programming languages like Python, and data manipulation libraries like Pandas.

2. **Machine Learning Mastery**: I'm excited to understand the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, from linear regression to deep learning. Hands-on projects will be a core aspect of this phase.

3. **Data Wrangling**: Real-world data is often messy. I'll explore techniques to clean, preprocess, and handle data effectively to ensure its quality and reliability.

4. **Data Visualization**: Learning to create compelling visualizations combining with web-developing skill that will be crucial. I aim to tell impactful stories through graphs and charts using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. **Advanced Topics**: As I progress, I'll tackle more advanced topics such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, depending on the direction my interests take.

6. **Projects, Projects, Projects**: I believe in learning by doing. I'll be working on hands-on projects that simulate real-world scenarios to apply what I've learned and showcase my skills.

7. **Collaboration and Learning**: I'm open to collaboration and feedback. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning together or if you have valuable insights to share.

8. **Master Data-Driven Decision Making**: To become proficient in using data to drive strategic business decisions.

9. **Contribute to Impactful Projects**: To contribute my skills to projects that positively impact organizations and society.

10. **Share Knowledge and Insights**: To share my knowledge and insights with the broader data science and business communities.

11. **Continuous Learning**: To continually learn and adapt in the fast-evolving field of Business Science.
