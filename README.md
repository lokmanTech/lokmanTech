# My Data Science Journey

Hello there, I'm Lokman Hakim. Welcome to my Data Science journey repository! Here, I'll be documenting my path towards becoming a proficient Data Scientist. Whether you're a fellow learner, a potential employer, or just someone curious about my progress, I hope you find this repository insightful and motivating.

## About Me

I'm passionate about data, analytics, and their potential to drive meaningful insights and informed decision-making. I come from a background in Architecture, which has provided me with a solid foundation in especially on problem-solving. However, I've always been intrigued by the world of data science and its endless possibilities, which is why I've decided to embark on this journey.

## Goals

1. **Learn the Fundamentals**: I'll start by diving into the basics of data science, including statistics, programming languages like Python, and data manipulation libraries like Pandas.

2. **Machine Learning Mastery**: I'm excited to understand the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, from linear regression to deep learning. Hands-on projects will be a core aspect of this phase.

3. **Data Wrangling**: Real-world data is often messy. I'll explore techniques to clean, preprocess, and handle data effectively to ensure its quality and reliability.

4. **Data Visualization**: Learning to create compelling visualizations will be crucial. I aim to tell impactful stories through graphs and charts using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. **Advanced Topics**: As I progress, I'll tackle more advanced topics such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, depending on the direction my interests take.

6. **Projects, Projects, Projects**: I believe in learning by doing. I'll be working on hands-on projects that simulate real-world scenarios to apply what I've learned and showcase my skills.

7. **Collaboration and Learning**: I'm open to collaboration and feedback. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning together or if you have valuable insights to share.
